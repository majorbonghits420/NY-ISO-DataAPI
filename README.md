# NY-ISO-DataAPI
Library for grabbing data from NYISO.com for electric market data.

This is a library that I wrote quick and dirty for a class project in which we analyized data from the realtime day ahead market from nyiso.com.
It's probably pretty fragile code, it worked for what I wanted, but probably not much else.
Currently it should be able to download realtime and dayahead market prices and put the data into matrices.

I might improve this to be able to scrap more of their site and/or right it not quick and dirty in order to practice Python/coding.
